							<h1> Photoshop </h1>
							<h2>My favourite thing to do </h2>
							<p>I spend a lot of my free time making photoshop composites. Some are based off of tutorials from other artists, which I follow in order to improve my own skills. However, I most enjoy using my own imagination to create new images. Aside from Photoshop, I am also developing my skills in Illustrator and Blender. Progress in those programs coming soon!</p>

							<h1> Coding </h1>
							<h2>A useful asset to have</h2>
							<p>I am not bad at coding, but definitely enjoy the creative side to it more. For example, I was far more passionate about creating the css of this website than building the body of it in html (although I can do that as well!). Furthermore, I have done some small projects in Processing. Click to see more about those.</p>

							<h1> Adobe XD App </h1>
							<h2> My Own Personal App!</h2>
							<p>As part of a school assignment, I created an Adobe XD app of myself. I used various techniques in order to create an app which worked well. It is designed for mobile and contains features such as a Parallax. I certainly enjoy the visual design aspects which Adobe XD offers. Click to see more.</p>

							<h1>Research </h1>
							<h2>Investigating what could go better!</h2>
							<p>Although research is not my favourite part of UX, it is very rewarding  when you start to see new insights. I have also partaken in user trialling for the rijksstudio website. This was part of a group project in which my group members and I each had to facillitate  a user navigating through the rijksstudio.nl website. Unfortunately, as we assured that the information shared during the trialing would only be used for educational purposes, I am unable to share this report at this moment in time.</p>

				<h2>UX designer</h2>
				<p>With my creativity I always seek the boundaries of what is possible and will go to the utmost to achieve that. My passion lies in digital creativity whether this be art or coding. I always put my team before myself although I will always argue my points of view and indicate when I disagree with someone so we can find a constructive solution. With my creativity I would like to make innovative products to help the environment. My goal would be to participate in the development of a carbon-negative city. At the moment, I am focused on digital design. Going to school in different cultural environments and living in different countries has taught me to be adaptable and has shaped me to be internationally minded.</p>
